    Hey!
    </p>

    <p>
    My name is Nabil ELQATIB. This is a small personal blog where I mainly share technical content.
    It was completely inactive for a few years, but I'm currently planning on posting regularly.
    </p>

    <p>
    Besides my work as an embedded software engineer, I am currently exploring two main topics in my free time: embedded Rust, and edge AI.
    </p>

    <p>
    For the moment, most content covers the following topics: <i>C/C++, Rust, Python, RTOS, MCUs, embedded Linux, network communication protocols, performance and benchmarking, reverse engineering</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
    You'll find the list of articles <a href={{ site.url }}/blog>here</a>.
    </p>

    You can reach out to me via email at <i><b>n dot elqatib at gmail dot com</b></i>, or via LinkedIn for professional enquiries.
