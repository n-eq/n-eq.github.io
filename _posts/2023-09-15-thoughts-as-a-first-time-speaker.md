Last week was my first time being at a conference from the other side of the stage, that is as a speaker.
With a colleague of mine, Elise Chouleur, we gave a talk on how we successfuly integrated a card reader into an already existing
full-software test suite. If you're interested, here is a link to the [talk](https://talk.com), and the [slides](https://slides.com).

I wanted to share some thoughts that can be seen as self-criticism or pieces of advice for better speaking performances. I am not sure this article w
    
## Rehearsing is very useful

We had rehearsed at least 4 or 5 times, most of them only between us, and a few times in front of other colleagues (unfortunately I had to do it remotely).
Rehearsing is key because it allows you to better prepare your speech for D-Day:
the more you rehearse, the better you know what you need to deliver when talking,
and the less you are susceptible to forget the key points of your talk, whether they are present
in the slides or not.
It is also necessary to calibrate your speaking time. By rehearsing, you can fine-tune
the time you want to allocate to each part of the talk. And as a result, it's easier to
spot situations where you're running out of time, or too much ahead of it.

## Try to occupy both hands


## Breathe, don't rush, allow some time during transitions

This is definitely waaay easier said than done, and is most probably my hardest problem
when publicly speaking.

## Don't be influenced by the audience's facial expressions

I guess one of the reasons I got easily distracted and stressful during the presentation
was that I misinterpreted some of the audience's facial expressions.
