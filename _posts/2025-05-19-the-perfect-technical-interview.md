I spent the past weeks interviewing for multiple positions at a handful of companies (startups, SMBs
and public institutions.) Through these experiences, I've developed a clearer view of what an ideal
technical interview format should look like.

Evaluating a software engineer's technical skillset within a limited amount of time is a fairly
difficult task.  In this short post, I'll specifically focus on the step where candidates are
expected to demonstrate their technical skills — excluding HR screening and team-fit interviews.

Arguably, the most common format companies rely on is the home-assignment coding challenge, where
candidates are asked to solve a programming puzzle and/or answer additional multiple choice
questions.  While this option can be relevant for _certain_ roles, it's often a very poor and
low-effort strategy solution.  In many cases, it reflects a lack of creativity or investment from
hiring teams, rather than a genuine attempt to evaluate real-world skills. \
Unless you think it is
appropriate for the role you're applying for, it should come as a red flag that you should probably
reconsider your application.


## Good technical interviews are thoughtful

When candidates invest time and effort into learning about a company, understanding its tech stack,
its culture, and values, it’s only fair to expect the same level of care from recruiters —
especially in how they craft and evaluate the technical interview step.

That is the reason why technical interviews should reflect genuineness and authenticity. A
well-designed, original task signals engagement from the company. In turn, serious candidates feel
more valued, and are more likely to develop a deeper interest in the role and the team.

When conducted well, technical interviews should foster side-discussions, encourage questions, and
allow for digressions — off-topic but still tech-related — that can offer a better grasp of the
person being interviewed.

## Good technical interviews are relevant

Similarly, an ideal technical interview should closely reflect the actual work expected in the role.
We often see one-size-fits-all abstract puzzles or classical DSA challenges that are largely
irrelevant for the position. This choice has two disadvantages:

1. It values profiles with strong theoretical backgrounds — or those with a great ability to recall
   textbook algorithms — over profiles with hands-on experience.
2. It fails to evaluate candidates against _real-world_ scenarios (unless the role involves a
   significant amount of algorithmic work.)

As a recruiter, this doesn't mean DSA knowledge isn't something to gauge during the process.
Depending on the position being applied for (software engineering is a very broad domain), you
should adjust the slider to make sure candidates have a decent background with regards to the job.
From a recruiter's standpoint, it's also a chance to explore a candidante's understanding of
programming concepts through the use of a specific language.

I tend to believe that a good technical interview should be an opportunity for candidates to get a
realistic foretaste of the daily challenges they’ll likely face. When done right, it becomes a
meaningful exchange: the company assesses the candidate’s fit, and the candidate gains insights of
the work culture and expectations.

## Good technical interviews should contain some elements of surprise

"Elements of surprise" might seem not quite appropriate in this context. However, good technical interviews
shouldn't be close-ended discussions leading to a rigidly scoped evaluation grid.  In fact,
deliberately introducing ambiguity, including _some_ unclear instructions or benign errors can
reveal a lot about a candidate.

Because in real-world engineering, specs are rarely complete, requirements shift, documentations are
often incomplete or outdated.  Far from tricking the candidate, by observing how they react during
this realistic scenario — whether they ask clarifying questions (this should be encouraged
beforehand in the assigment instructions), or challenge assumptions — it's about evaluating their
critical thinking abilities, collaborative behavior, and adaptability; the qualities that often make
the difference between a good engineer and a great one.
