excerpt: "A small piece on Zephyr's build system's fundamentals"

When I first ventured into Zephyr Project, I was met with a build system that
felt both familiar and foreign. Having worked with CMake in other projects,
I assumed the transition would be straightforward. However, Zephyr introduces
its own layer with `west`, `Kconfig`, and `DeviceTree`, adding ~~some~~ a bunch
of complexity to the build process. \
This article aims to demystify Zephyr's build system to newcomers by breaking
down its components and illustrating how they interact.

## The role of West

At its core is Zephyr's `west` meta-tool (_why "west"? because Zephyr is the
name of west wind, before being an RTOS_), commonly seen as a swiss knife to
work with Zephyr. It's designed to manage multiple repositories and streamline
the build process. It also handles tasks like fetching dependencies, building
applications, and flashing firmware to devices.

For the sake of simplicity, we'll assume for the
rest of this article that you have correctly installed dependencies and have
a Zephyr workspace already set up. If it's not the case, the official
documentation can be found
[here](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#get-zephyr-and-install-python-dependencies).

## Anatomy of a Zephyr application

The simplest Zephyr application includes the following files:

```
my_app/
    ├── src/
    │ └── main.c 
    ├── prj.conf
    └── CMakeLists.txt
 ```

* `main.c`: Contains the `main()` function. It's the entry point of your application.
* `prj.conf`: Specifies configuration options using Kconfig syntax.
* `CMakeLists.txt`: Defines how to build the application using CMake.

Example `CMakeLists.txt`:

```
cmake cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.20.0)
find_package(Zephyr REQUIRED HINTS $ENV{ZEPHYR_BASE})
project(my_app)

target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c)
```

This setup tells CMake to include Zephyr's build system and compile `main.c` as
part of the application. In particular, we can make two observations on this
minimal CMakeLists file:
- There is only one source file to compile (`target_sources`).
- `ZEPHYR_BASE` needs to be defined in the environment variables.


## Building the application

To build the application for a specific board:

```bash
west build -b <board_name> path/to/my_app
```

This command performs several steps:

1. **Configuration**: CMake processes `CMakeLists.txt`, integrating Zephyr's build system.
2. **Kconfig processing**: Reads `prj.conf` and other Kconfig files to generate a `.config` file.
3. **DeviceTree processing**: Parses the board's DeviceTree files to generate hardware definitions.
4. **Compilation**: Uses Ninja (default) or Make to compile the application
   and Zephyr kernel into a firmware image.

The output is placed in a `build/` directory that contains artifacts like
`zephyr.elf`, `zephyr.hex`, and `zephyr.bin`.

## Understanding prj.conf and Kconfig

The `prj.conf` file allows you to enable or configure various features of Zephyr. For example:

```
CONFIG_GPIO=y
CONFIG_LOG=y
CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE=1024
```

These options are processed by Kconfig to generate a `.config` file, which in turn influences the
build process and the behavior of the application.

You can also interactively configure available options:

```bash
west build -t menuconfig
```

This opens a terminal-based interface to modify configuration options, similar to `make menuconfig`
in the Linux kernel.

## DeviceTree overlays

Zephyr uses DeviceTree to describe hardware components (one of its many
similarities with the Linux kernel.) To customize hardware configurations, you
can create board-specific overlay files inside `boards/`.

```
my_app/
├── boards/
│   ├── rpi_pico.overlay
│   └── arduino_nano_33_ble.overlay
```

The concept of device tree overlays is adding custom layers to describe (add,
remove, modify) peripherals of the used microcontroller. \
For example, an overlay file that enables an onboard LED (`led0`):

```
dts &led0 {
    status = "okay";
};
```


This overlay modifies the board's DeviceTree to enable `led0`. During the build process, Zephyr
merges this overlay with the base DeviceTree to generate hardware definitions.

## Common build options

* **Pristine Builds**: To ensure a clean build environment (to force the
  rebuild for another board for example):

```bash
west build -p always -b <board_name> path/to/my_app
```

* **Specifying Build Directory**: To build in a specific directory:

```bash
west build -b <board_name> -d build_dir path/to/my_app
```
