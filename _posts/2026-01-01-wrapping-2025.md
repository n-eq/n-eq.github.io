Last year was kind of a roller coaster for me.\
I published 10 blog posts from May to August, but none since September. I went
through some difficulties on a professional level (maybe more on that
later...), managed to resuscitate my blog after three years of inactivity, only
to let it helplessly die again due to a combination of lack of time (a new job
and personal matters) and ideas.

At times, it was so hard that I didn’t even manage to find enough time to write
this 10-line blog post.
